# Arrays

## What is an array?

In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index by a mathematical formula.

Let's use example to define an array;
Example: Box Of Macaroons

- It is a box of macaroons.

- All macaroons in this box are next to each other.

- Each macaroon can be identified uniquely based on their location(index).

- The size of the box cannot be changed.

Typical array is like this [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9]

## The properties of an array

- Array can store data of specified data type

- Elements of an array are located in a contiguous

- Each element of an array has a unique index

- The size of an array is predefined and cannot be modified.
