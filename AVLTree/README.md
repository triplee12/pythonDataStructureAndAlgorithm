# AVL Tree

An AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between the height of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes.

If at any time heights of left and right subtrees differ by more than one, the rebalancing is done to restore AVL property, this process is called rotation.
