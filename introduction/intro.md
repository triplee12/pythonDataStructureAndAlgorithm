# What are Data Structures?

- Data Structures are different ways of constructing and organizing data on computer systems, that can be used effectively.

Example:
Let say you have logs of woods that are not organized, if you want to choose a black one then you have to check them one by one since it is not in organized way. Selecting a black one will be time consuming.

Okay, let look at the organized way of these items. So selecting a black one will be so easy because you have organized them according to their color and size.

## What is an Algorithm?

It is a set of steps to solve a problem or accomplish a task.

Set of rules for a computer program to solve a problem.

From Input data ==> Calculation ==> Stop when the problem is solved.

Let use example above. To solve the problem above, you have to:

1. Choosing flooring

2. Purchase and bring

3. Prepare sub flooring

4. Determine the layout

5. Trim door casing

## What makes a good Algorithm?

1. Correctness
2. Efficiency

## Why ara data structures and algorithms important?

1. Data Processing Methods

- Input data
- Processing data
- Output data

2. Problem solving skill

## Types of data structures

1. Primitive Data Structures

- Integer
- Float
- Character
- String
- Boolean

2. Nonprimitive Data Structures

- Linear Data Structures
    1. Static Linear

    - Array

    2. Dynamic Linear

    - Linked List
    - Stack
    - Queue

- Non Linear Data Structures

    1. Tree
    2. Graph


## Types of Algorithms

1. Simple recursive algorithms
2. Divide and conquer algorithms

- Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems of the same type, and solve these sub-problems recursively.

- Combine the solutions to the sub-problems into a solution to the original problem.

3. Dynamic programming algorithms

- They work based on memoization
- To find the best solution

4. Greedy algorithms

- We take the best we can without worrying about future consequences.

- We hope that by choosing a local optimum solution at each iteration, we will end up at a global optimum solution.

5. Brute force algorithms

- It simply tries all possibilties until a satisfactory solution is found.

6. Randomized algorithms

- Use a random number at least once during the computation to make a decision.
