# Linked List

Linked List is a form of a sequential collection and it does not have to be in order. A linked list is made up of independent nodes that may contain any type of data and each node has a reference to the next node in the linked list.

Let's look at real life example:
A train contains couches(nodes) and links(houks), head and tail which is the first couch(node) is the head and the last couch(node) is the tail.

- Each couch is independent
- Couches: passengers and links (nodes and links)

## Types of linked list

- Single Linked List
- Double Linked List

## Create, Insert, Access, Delete, Update in Linked List
