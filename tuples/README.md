# Python Tuples

## What is tuple?

- A tuple is an immutable sequence of python objects.
Tuple are also comparable and hashable.

## How can we create a tuple?

- t = ("a", "b", "c")

To create a single element in a tuple, you have to end the tuple with comma ","

Example: pet = ("Cat",)

Otherwise, python will treate it as a string.

Another way to create a tuple is using the tuple() function.

myTuple = tuple() <!-- Empty tuple -->
