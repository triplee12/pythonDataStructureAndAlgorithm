# Divide and conquer algorithm

Divide and conquer is an algorithm design paradigm which works by recursively breaking down a problem into subproblems of similar type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solution to the subproblems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

## Property of Divide and Conquer Algorithm

- Optimal substructure
If any problem's overall optimal solution can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems then this problem has optimal substructure.

Example: Fib(n) = Fib(n - 1) + Fib(n - 2)

## Why we nned it?

- It is very effective when the problem has optimal substructure property.
