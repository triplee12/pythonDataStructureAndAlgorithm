# Binary Search Tree

- In the left subtree, the value of a node is less than or equal to its parent node's value.
- In the right subtree, the value of a node is greater than its parent node's value.

## Why do we need a binary search tree?

- It performs faster than Binary Tree when inserting and deleting nodes.
