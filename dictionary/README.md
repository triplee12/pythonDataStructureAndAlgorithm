# Dictionaries

A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable, and indexed.

In programming, we use a dictionary to associate a key with a value. {key:value}

Miler: a person who owns or works in a rice mill.

myDict = {"miller": "a person who owns or works in a rice mill"}

"miller" is "key"
"a person who owns or works in a rice mill" is "value"
